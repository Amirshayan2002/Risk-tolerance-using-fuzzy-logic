The article focuses on risk tolerance, which is a crucial factor in decision-making processes in economic and financial domains. It argues that traditional methods of measuring risk tolerance are precise but inefficient, and may lead to inaccurate decisions. It proposes fuzzy logic as a more effective and dynamic tool that can provide a wider and more accurate assessment of risk tolerance. Using fuzzy sets and fuzzy inference systems, the article presents a new framework that can handle the ambiguities and uncertainties related to risk tolerance. The article claims that this approach can produce a better, more accurate, and more comprehensive evaluation of risk tolerance. It also shows that risk tolerance is influenced by various parameters, such as the age, investment horizon, capital, and status of the investor, and that these parameters may vary in different periods.
